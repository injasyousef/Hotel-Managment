# Inventory Management System
## Overview :

The Hotel Management System is designed to streamline operations for both hotel employees and guests. This system offers a range of functionalities that enhance the customer experience and improve operational efficiency. It is developed using Spring Boot and provides a set of RESTful APIs to support web and mobile interfaces. The system ensures secure, role-based access control, allowing different functionalities for admin and customer roles. The project includes detailed API documentation, secure JWT-based authentication, and the use of Docker for easy deployment.

<h2>Bill Table</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> id, reservation, date, dueDate, amount, status.</p>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Many-to-One relationship with the Reservation table (each bill is associated with one reservation).</li>
</ul>

<h2>HouseKeepingTask Table</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> id, room, employee, taskDescription, taskDate, completedDate, status.</p>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Many-to-One relationship with the Room table (each housekeeping task is associated with one room).</li>
    <li>Many-to-One relationship with the User table (each housekeeping task is performed by one employee).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reservation Table</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> id, customer, room, checkInDate, checkOutDate, numberOfDays, price.</p>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Many-to-One relationship with the User table (each reservation is made by one customer).</li>
    <li>Many-to-One relationship with the Room table (each reservation is associated with one room).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Room Table</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> id, roomNo, type, price, capacity, size, status.</p>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Referenced by the HouseKeepingTask table.</li>
    <li>Referenced by the Reservation table.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Table</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> id, name, email, phoneNumber, pass, role.</p>
<strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Referenced by the HouseKeepingTask table (employees).</li>
    <li>Referenced by the Reservation table (customers).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The User entity represents all users in the system, categorized by roles (EMPLOYEE, ADMIN, CUSTOMER).</p>
<p>Reservation links customers (User) to rooms (Room).</p>
<p>Bill is associated with a specific reservation.</p>
<p>HouseKeepingTask is linked to rooms and the employees (User) who perform the tasks.</p>
<p>These relationships ensure a structured and organized database schema, facilitating effective management of reservations, billing, and housekeeping tasks within the hotel management system.</p>

### Meaning of swgger :
Swagger UI allows anyone to visualize and interact with the API‚Äôs resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It‚Äôs automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
## My APIs are built using the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification.
